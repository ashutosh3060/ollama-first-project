# Notes:

Ollama : Ollama is a tool designed to simplify the process of running open-source large language models (LLMs) directly on your computer.
Benefits: To check quickly in your local machine, which all open source models work well for our own usecase.

Basic command to run a LLM model:
ollama run llama3.2

Create your own model with Ollama:
Ollama supports importing GGUF models in the Modelfile: GGUF(GPT-generated unified format)
Below is the code example
1. Create a file named Modelfile, with a FROM instruction with the local filepath to the model you want to import.
    FROM ./vicuna-33b.Q4_0.gguf
2. Create the model in Ollama
    ollama create example -f Modelfile
3. Run the model
    ollama run example

Top 3 tasks here with the learning
1. Create your own model
2. Access your created model in Jupyter notebook
3. Create a Gradio Interface for input and LLM results: request.py -> Use it in the form of API.
